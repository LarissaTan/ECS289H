The rate remained high for a prolonged period (2009–2011) after the initial economic shock, indicating a slow, multi-year recovery in the labor market. The failure to meet the stated political goal by the end of 2010 suggests that the economic recovery timeline was more protracted than initially anticipated."

This pattern suggests that the depicted behavior or attitude is a generational characteristic that fades with age, or that younger individuals are early adopters.
